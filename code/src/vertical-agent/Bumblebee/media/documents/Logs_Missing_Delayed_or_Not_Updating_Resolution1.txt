#Issue

If any of the following issues are being experienced:
 * Application logs are missing for a specific period.
 * Debug logs are unavailable in production.
 * Logs are not appearing in real-time in the ELK stack.
 * Logging pipeline latency issues observed.

#Environment

 * Affected Applications: Web-based applications, API services, backend processing systems
 * Operating Systems: Linux (RHEL, Ubuntu), Windows Server
 * Logging Stack: ELK, Splunk, Fluentd

#Cause

 * Log collection agent stopped or crashed (e.g., Filebeat, Fluentd, Splunk Forwarder).
 * High ingestion load on the logging pipeline causing delays.
 * Incorrect log level configuration (debug logs disabled in production).
 * Network latency between log source and ingestion system.
 * Log indexing issues in Elasticsearch or Splunk.

#Resolution 

1. Verify the Log Source:
 * Check if the application is writing logs to the expected file/directory.
 * Run: tail -f /var/log/app.log to confirm log generation.

2. Check Log Forwarder Status:
 * For ELK: systemctl status filebeat (restart if stopped).
 * For Splunk: splunk status and restart if needed.

3. Check Log Ingestion Pipeline:
 * Verify if Logstash, Fluentd, or other aggregators are running.
 * Check Logstash queue: curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9600/_node/stats/pipeline'

4. Review Network and Load Issues:
 * Check network latency to the logging server: ping <logging-server>
 * Ensure log ingestion services have enough resources (top, df -h)

5. Validate Log Configuration:
 * Ensure logging levels are set correctly (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR).
 * If using Kubernetes, check container logs: kubectl logs <pod_name>.
